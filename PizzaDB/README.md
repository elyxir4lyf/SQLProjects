## Project Brief: Designing a Relational Database for a Pizzeria
---
---

### Overview:
---
The project involves designing and building a tailor-made bespoke relational database for a new Pizzeria that will allow capturing and storing all important information and data generated by the business. The database will help monitor business performance in dashboards that will be built later. The three main areas of concentration include customer orders, stock levels, and staff.

### Objectives:
---
<ul>
    <li> Design and build a relational database for customer orders that will capture and store all important information and data generated by the business.</li>
    <li> Normalize the data, add more related tables, and define table relationships.</li>
    <li> Design and build dashboards to monitor business performance.</li>
    <li> Design and build databases for stock control data and staff data.</li>
</ul>

### Scope:
---
The project will cover the following areas:
<ul>
    <li>__Customer orders:__ The database will capture and store item name, item price, quantity, customer name, delivery address, order ID field, delivery address split out into different parts, different sizes of pizzas and beverages as a separate field, and product category.</li>
    <li> __Stock control data:__ The database will capture and store information on what ingredients go into each pizza, their quantity based on the size of the pizza, and the existing stock level.</li>
    <li> __Staff data:__ The database will capture and store information on which staff members are working when and how much each pizza is actually costing in terms of ingredients, chefs making the pizza, and the cost of delivery based on the time it took to deliver.</li>
    </ul>
   
   
### Approach:
---
The approach to designing the database involves specifying all fields for the data that need to be collected, normalizing the data, adding more related tables, and defining table relationships. Quick Database Diagrams (Quick DBD) is used as a tool to make the job of designing and building the database easier.


### Deliverables:
---
<ul>
    <li> A tailor-made bespoke relational database for customer orders that captures and stores all important information and data generated by the business.</li>
    <li> Dashboards to monitor business performance.</li>
    <li>Databases for stock control data and staff data.</li>
</ul>

### Timeline:
---
The project is expected to be completed within 2 months.


### Budget:
---
The budget for the project is $50,000.


### Assumptions:
---
<ul>
    <li> The front-end ordering system will be built by someone else.</li>
    <li> The project will be completed within the specified timeline and budget.</li>
    <li> No external tools or services will be used to design or build the database.</li>
</ul>
